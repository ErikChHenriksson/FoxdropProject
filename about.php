				Foxdrop started as a group project between two KTH students, but then transitioned into a fully functional website as a result of our continued development on our spare time. We love to share the things we work with and this is a perfect way to do just that. Hopefully, you find great joy in interacting with our website and we want to encourage you to share these experiences with your friends and family.
