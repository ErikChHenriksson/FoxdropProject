							Foxdrop started as a group project between two KTH students in Sweden. We continued to develop Foxdrop on our spare time, and today it is a fully functional online platform to play games and watch animations on. We have created all this content for you the reader and we wish that you find great joy in playing our games and watching our animations. We encourage you to share these experiences with your friends and family.  
						<br>
						<br>
							Do not hesitate to ask any questions or make requests about functionality that you'd like us to add. Go to "Contact" for more information about how to get in touch with us. 
						<br>
						<br>
							We are very thankful for the time you took to visit our website!
