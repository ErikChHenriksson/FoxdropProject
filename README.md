## Project Description
On Foxdrop there are games to play and animations to watch. A database is used to store user information, highscores and to reset passwords. Users may sign up to get access to game leaderboards and to view a leaderboard accessed from the League of Legends REST API.

## Project Goals
Website should function as a place for people to visit and enjoy some animations and games. If they want, they can attempt to beat their own or other peoples' high scores in the games for fun or competition.

The website should follow these <b>10 heuristics as specified by Jakob Nielsen:

<b>
Visibility of system status <br>
Match between system and the real world <br>
User control and freedom <br>
Consistency and standards <br>
Error prevention <br>
Recognition rather than recall <br>
Flexibility and efficiency of use <br>
Aesthetic and minimalist design <br>
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors <br>
Help and documentation <br>
<br>
