## Project Description
Website implementing games, animations together with a database collecting user information such as username, e-mail and password. Users may register to get highscores and see exclusive League of Legends API.

## Project Goals
Website should function as a place for people to visit and enjoy some animations and games. If they want, they can attempt to beat their own or other peoples high scores in the games for fun or competition.

The website should follow these 10 heuristics as specified by Nielsen:

Visibility of system status <br>
Match between system and the real world <br>
User control and freedom <br>
Consistency and standards <br>
Error prevention <br>
Recognition rather than recall <br>
Flexibility and efficiency of use <br>
Aesthetic and minimalist design <br>
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors <br>
Help and documentation <br>
<br>

How well the usability has been made will be evaluated through a think aloud test session with an end user and a few questions prepared for each of the heuristics. <br>
